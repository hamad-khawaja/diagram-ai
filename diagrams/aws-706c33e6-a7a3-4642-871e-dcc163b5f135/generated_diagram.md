The provided AWS architecture diagram code represents a Three-Tier Architecture using AWS components. Here's a breakdown of the components in correct AWS terminology:

- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Represents the isolated virtual network environment in which the architecture is deployed.
- Public Subnet: A subnet within the VPC that is accessible from the internet.
    - Internet Gateway: Allows external access to resources within the VPC.
    - ALB (Application Load Balancer): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
    - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances: Represent the web servers for the presentation layer (Web Server 1, Web Server 2).
- Private Subnet: A subnet within the VPC that is not directly accessible from the internet.
    - Aurora: Represents the Aurora Database for the data layer.

Connectivity:
- The Internet Gateway enables external access to the architecture and routes traffic to the Load Balancer.
- The Load Balancer directs incoming traffic to the EC2 instances in the Public Subnet.
- Each EC2 instance communicates with the Aurora Database in the Private Subnet for data operations.

This architecture aligns with AWS best practices by separating presentation and data layers, utilizing EC2 instances for compute, Aurora Database for storage, and appropriate networking components within a VPC.
