Design an AWS architecture with:

Required imports:
```python
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import Aurora
```

1. EC2 instances for the presentation layer to host the web application (using diagrams.aws.compute.EC2)
2. Aurora database for the data layer to store and manage the application data (using diagrams.aws.database.Aurora)

Ensure proper connectivity between the EC2 instances and the Aurora database to establish a three-tier architecture following AWS best practices.
