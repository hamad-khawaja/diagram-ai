# Template: High-Quality Input for OpenAI LLM Diagram Generation

Use this template to maximize the quality and correctness of diagrams code generated by the LLM.

---

**Prompt Example:**

```
Generate Python code using the diagrams library (v0.24.4) to visualize the following AWS architecture:

- One VPC node
- Two private subnets (represented as clusters labeled "Private Subnet 1" and "Private Subnet 2")
- Each subnet contains three EC2 instances
- All EC2 instances connect to a single NAT Gateway
- The VPC node connects to the NAT Gateway

**Requirements:**
- Use only valid resources and imports from diagrams v0.24.4 (see https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/nodes/aws/network)
- Do NOT use or invent nodes that do not exist (e.g., Subnet as a node)
- Represent subnets as clusters, not nodes
- Use direction="TB" for top-to-bottom layout
- Add comments for clarity
- Output must be complete, error-free, and runnable as-is
- Use only the diagrams library and standard Python

**Example pattern:**

from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster
from diagrams.aws.network import VPC, NATGateway
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2

with Diagram("VPC with Subnets", show=False, direction="TB"):
    vpc = VPC("VPC")
    with Cluster("Private Subnet 1"):
        priv1 = [EC2("priv1-1"), EC2("priv1-2"), EC2("priv1-3")]
        nat = NATGateway("NAT GW")
        for inst in priv1:
            inst >> nat
    with Cluster("Private Subnet 2"):
        priv2 = [EC2("priv2-1"), EC2("priv2-2"), EC2("priv2-3")]
        for inst in priv2:
            inst >> nat
    vpc >> nat
```

**Tips:**
- Always specify the diagrams version and require only valid resources.
- Ask for clusters for subnets, AZs, or logical groupings.
- Request comments and a specific layout direction if needed.
- For complex diagrams, break your request into smaller, testable parts.
